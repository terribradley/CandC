              I am a musician, artist, and educator teaching piano lessons in North and Northeast Portland. I teach students from Beginner to Intermediate, Age 5 to 105. My piano lessons are based on a foundation in technique, music theory, and piano repertoire. I use several different books and methods and my own unique and challenging curriculum in order to make learning the piano fun and accessible.

              I teach from a classical foundation because I believe it leads to artistry, yet incorporate many different genres of music from jazz to pop. I want my students to explore their musical curiosity. My students also receive instruction in practicing skills, sight reading, performance, ear training, and music history and appreciation in a fun and encouraging environment.

              I received my MFA from Pacific Northwest College of Art in Portland in 2013. I have over 20 years of piano experience and have also been an accompanist for choirs, musical theater, and a violin school. I have also worked in early education for over 10 years, taught in after-school programs, and co-run a summer art and music camp for kids. When I am not teaching or playing piano, I am making art in my studio or exploring the Northwest. I am a firm believer in the importance of music and art education and am dedicated to creating a meaningful and innovative curriculum.
